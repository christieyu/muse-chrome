Hello, Muse user!
====================

### To download the Muse Chrome extension, please go to: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/muse.

There should be a button to the right of the screen that says "More extensions." Upon clicking this page, please scroll until you see an extension called "Muse" created by user "christie.yu." Its description is "A customizable homepage with a simple, minimalistic design." The logo is a coral circle with a "M" in the middle.

You can also try to find this extension under the URL "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/muse/ogeijoljcknnpabbmifnpajjeacnpadh," but this URL is finnicky for some reason...
